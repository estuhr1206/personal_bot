# Using this bot

This bot has a bunch of random features that I'm trying my hand at implementing, such as a timer, simple text file reading and outputting, etc.
Feel free to take the file and run it in your own server, you'll simply have to follow the guide to make your own .env file with your own token that
discord should provide. 

You'll also want to change the text file, although the command to load it should be able to take in different names.
